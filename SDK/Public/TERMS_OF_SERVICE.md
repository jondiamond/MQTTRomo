## Terms of Service

Thank you for using the Romotive Software Development Kit (the "Romotive SDK"). By using the Romotive SDK, you agree to the terms below. If you disagree with any of these terms, Romotive does not grant you a license to use the Romotive SDK. We reserve the right to update and change these terms from time to time without notice. You can always find the most recent version of these terms here http://romotive.com/developers/tos/.

Your license to the Romotive SDK under these terms continues until it is terminated by either party. You may terminate the license by discontinuing use of all or any parts of the Romotive SDK. Romotive may terminate the license at any time for any reason. Your rights to use the Romotive SDK terminate automatically if (i) you violate any of these terms, (ii) Romotive publicly posts a written notice of termination on romotive.com, (iii) Romotive sends a written notice of termination to you, or (iv) Romotive disables access to the Romotive SDK to you.

These terms define legal use of the Romotive SDK, all updates, revisions, substitutions, and any copies of the Romotive SDK made by or for you. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Romotive.

##### a. You shall:

- Disclose in your application, through a privacy policy, on how you collect, use, store, and disclose data collected from visitors, including, where applicable, that third parties (including advertisers) may serve content and/or advertisements and collect information directly from visitors. 


##### You shall not:

- Distribute the Romotive SDK (or any of its components) in any way.

- Sell, lease, or sublicense Romotive SDK or access thereto or derive revenues from the use or provision of Romotive SDK, whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or otherwise, except as set forth below.

### 2. Commercial Use.

If the primary purpose of your application is to derive revenue, it is considered a commercial application. Romotive reserves the right to make this evaluation at any time.

If you're in doubt about whether your application is commercial, here are a few common examples of commercial use that may provide you some guidance:

- Users are charged a fee for your product or service which includes some sort of integration using the Romotive SDK.
- You sell services to Romotive users and use the SDK to bring users' Romotive content into.

Non-commercial uses could include:

- Educational uses of the SDK
- Building personal apps for Romo

Commercial use of the Romotive SDK is permitted with one simple rule. Upon releasing any software that harnesses Romotive SDK for commercial use, you **must** send an email to <developers@romotive.com> with a link to the application that uses the Romotive SDK.

### 3. Attribution.

You may not use the the name, trademarks, or logos of Romotive to endorse or promote products derived from the Romotive SDK without specific prior written permission from Romotive.

### 6. Fees and Payments.

Romotive is committed to free and open access to our SDK for commercial, non-commercial and educational purposes. However, providing the SDK does have real costs for Romotive.
