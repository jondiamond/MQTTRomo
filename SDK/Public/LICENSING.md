# Romotive SDK
---
## Licensing

Romotive wants to make it very easy for people to get rolling with our SDK, so here are some "human-readable" guidelines that all developers should follow.

### Use common sense
--------------------
If you're unsure, ask us. Our [terms of service](http://romotive.com/developers/tos/) allow for most reasonable uses. If you're doing something you think might be a problem or if you have any questions, just contact us at <developers@romotive.com>.

### Read the Terms of Service
-----------------------------
Before you start developing anything using the Romotive SDK, you need to read and abide by the full [terms of service](http://romotive.com/developers/tos/).

### Commercial Use
------------------
The Romotive SDK is free for commercial, non-commercial, and educational purposes. If you release any commercial software using the Romotive SDK, all we ask is that you send us an email to let us know. That's it!

### Respect user privacy
------------------------
Disclose in your application (through a privacy policy) how you will collect, use, store, and disclose data collected from users. 

If your app transmits video, audio, or pictures captured from the iDevice outside of its local network, you must get confirmation from the user through a prominent UI notification.

### Your brand != our brand
---------------------------
Don't use the name, trademarks, or logos of Romotive to endorse or promote products derived from the Romotive SDK without specific prior written permission from Romotive.

### Don't do anything illegal
-----------------------------
Don't use the SDK in connection with anything that promotes or takes part in any products, services, or materials that we would consider malicious, hateful, or illegal.

### Help us keep things under control
-------------------------------------
Don't use the SDK in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume for remote server calls, or constitutes abusive usage as determined by Romotive. 

### Build awesome stuff
-----------------------
Above all else, we want to see people build awesome stuff with our SDK. If you need help, shoot us an email. If something is broken, let us know. If you need a new feature, tell us what it is. And if you build something awesome, show it to us so we can show the world how awesome you are.
